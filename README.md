1. **Wi-Fi Network Scan (nmcli)**
2. **Wi-Fi Network Scan (netsh)**
3. **Wi-Fi Network Scan (iwlist)**
4. **Configure Wi-Fi (iwconfig)**
5. **Network Scan (arp-scan)**
6. **Network Scan (nmap)**
7. **Connectivity Test (ping)**
8. **Route Tracing (traceroute/tracert)**
9. **DNS Query (dig)**
10. **DNS Query (host)**
11. **Wi-Fi Network Scan (iw)**
12. **Monitoring Mode (airmon-ng)**
13. **Packet Capture (airodump-ng)**
14. **Password Cracking (aircrack-ng)**
15. **WPS Vulnerability Testing (reaver)**
16. **Network Testing (mdk3)**
17. **WPS Scanning (wash)**
18. **Handshake Capture (hcxdumptool)**
19. **Captured File Conversion (hcxpcapngtool)**
20. **MAC Address Change (macchanger)**
